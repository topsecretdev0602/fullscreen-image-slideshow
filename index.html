          <h1>Phuket, Thailand</h1>
          <p>
            Phuket attracts travelers looking for a taste of exotic Thailand.
            The Andaman Sea's aquamarine-tinted water provides a striking
            contrast to the stark white sand beaches and emerald jungles that
            line the coast. Travelers to Phuket will want to spend plenty of
            time on the beach but should also set aside some time to explore the
            area's flavorful culinary scene, tour its impressive Buddhist
            temples and sail or snorkel on a boat tour.
